## What is CoderDojo?
CoderDojo is an open source, volunteer led, global movement of free computer coding clubs for young people.

Find out more about the global movement at coderdojo.com

## What do kids do at CoderDojo?
At CoderDojo Porirua, kids work through a range of self-paced online tutorials such as Hour of Code (for beginners) and Codecademy or Codecombat. There are plenty of adult mentors on hand to help them if they get stuck, and we also encourage kids to help each other. We get kids involved in fun digital projects such as building a computer from scratch, and run projects for more advanced kids using Arduinos, Raspberry Pis and other digital technology. As we evolve our curriculum will expand.

## When and where do we meet?
Every second Sunday during term times, from 3 – 4.30pm, at [Porirua College](/about/were.html)

## Can I drop my child off at CoderDojo and pick them up later?
No. A parent or caregiver must stay with kids for the whole session.

## How much does it cost?
CoderDojo is free.

## Can I help?
Yes! If you have a technology or teaching background, or have another skill that you are willing to share with the club, please get in touch with Emily at embly.hunt@gmail.com.

## What is the history of CoderDojo Porirua?
CoderDojo Porirua began as a parent co-operative initiated by a group of like-minded parents. Our first session was in May 2013 at the offices of Splice Group Ltd in Mana (where two of our founding members – Leigh Hunt and Richard Redman – were business owners). Our other founding members were Mark Honeychurch, Trevor Hart, Nev Atkinson, Glenn Gilbert and Ross Brown. Splice Group was our venue until late 2013.

In March 2014, we moved to the e-Learning suite at Porirua RSA. This move has meant a period of rapid expansion for the club. A number of new mentors came on board, with a range of skills and experience. The organisation of the CoderDojo has become more structured, we are expanding our curriculum and we have also introduced a belt and badge system to reward the progress of our coders.

In July 2014 CoderDojo Porirua became a registered charitable trust. We continue to grow.

I’m interested in setting up a CoderDojo in my area. Can you help?
Yes! We’d love to work with groups who want to set up more New Zealand CoderDojos. Please contact Mark via email at mark@honeychurch.org or mobile on 021 885 216.

## What do the kids think of CoderDojo?
“Programming is like a big powerful sword that you have to learn how to use and then your creativity is unleashed”
Eli, 10

“It’s cool because we get to do lots of coding, and get to do Angry Birds!”
Sam, 5
