Coder Dojo is a free club where kids can learn to code. All children are welcome. At the moment, we run a session each month during the school term on a Sunday at Porirua College.

> If you are currently at a CoderDojo session, please go to the [Welcome page](/welcome) for instructions on how to get started.
