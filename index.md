Coder Dojo is a free club where kids can learn to code. All children are welcome. At the moment, we run a session each month during the school term on a Sunday at Porirua College.

If you have any ideas you would like to pursue we're always happy to help or advise (as best we can).  Projects can be a great way to learn new skills and give a goal to investigate how to make things work.  There are some ideas in the resources pages.

> If you are currently at a CoderDojo session, please go to the [Welcome page](/welcome) for instructions on how to get started.
