# How to Join

We use the CoderDojo platform (Zen) to organise our sessions.

To signup to Zen users must be 13+. Parents or guardians over 18 can sign up, and then register your child(ren), this can be for youths either under or over 13.

Sign up for Zen at [https://zen.coderdojo.com/register/user](https://zen.coderdojo.com/register/user). Once registered you will be able to add Children, and the Porirua CoderDojo as your dojo.

Upcoming CoderDojo sessions will be shown on the [Porirua CoderDojo Event Page](https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojos/nz/wellington/porirua/porirua). Once you are signed up to the Zen platform and have added the Porirua CoderDojo, you can track events through 'My Events'

Please contact us if you have any questions or issues in signing up for events.
