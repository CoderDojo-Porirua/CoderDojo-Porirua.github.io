How to Join  
We use Meetup to organise our sessions.

Meetup users must be 18+. Parents or caregivers sign up for Meetup, and join the CoderDojo Porirua group. You will need to complete a CoderDojo Porirua registration form for each child.

To attend a session, you need to RSVP for yourself, and add your child(ren) as guests (+1 etc.). Parents or caregivers must attend all sessions with their child(ren).

You should receive an email confirmation from Meetup stating that you are attending our session. If our session is full, you should receive an email stating that you are on our waitlist. Sessions are very busy at the moment. If you turn up to a session without a confirmation of attendance, we can not guarantee a spot.

Please contact us if you do not receive any email confirmation from Meetup about your RSVP.

Registration overview
1. [Sign up for Meetup](https://secure.meetup.com/register/) if necessary. Note this is completely separate from the CoderDojo Porirua registration.
2. [RSVP to the next session.](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoPorirua/)
3. Complete the [CoderDojo Porirua Registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xeTIbR_vYanQN4bgTHVP2yntHb7BZBr4z0D8fX4Hnro/viewform) for each coder.
4. Receive confirmation of attendance or waitlist.

RSVPs for each session open up at the start of the previous session – this is to try and ensure that if a session is full, that coders who didn’t attend that session get a chance to sign up for the next one.
