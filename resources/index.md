The resources menu has some sites which provide interesting ways to learn programming. The CoderDojo site (linked in with their partner Raspberry Pi) has some great ideas for projects at [https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects).

If they include hardware (like a Raspberry Pi), we may not have them, but feel free to ask, or pick one of the Scratch or HTML projects.
