# Tynker

Tynker is a site that teaches programming for kids. There are a lot of different activities there, although many are covered in the paid for section of the site.

## Simple Minecraft Modding

Some of the free activities on the site include some minecraft modding tutorials. Since this site uses block style coding its more accessible than the full mod coding.

You can try out modding [here.](https://www.tynker.com/minecraft/)
