[App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/) can be used to create applications that can be run on an Android phone.

The site allows you to create an app in your browser using coding blocks, and then upload that to a phone and watch it run.

There is a guide to [getting started here](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/get-started.html), and [tutorial projects here](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials.html)


## Project Idea

If you want to try something different, here's an idea for another project.  The plan is to create an app that will stop someone from taking your phone, and if it does get taken then keep track of it.

1. Create a new project.
2. Skip the survey.

###Speaking a warning when someone picks up the phone###
1. Add a Button, and a Text to speech component (from Media)
2. Add some code to the button to say something when the button is pressed.  This demonstrates the speech setup.

4. Now Add an Accelerometer (from Sensors), and set it up to report its value to the button text

... more to come as we work through this project
