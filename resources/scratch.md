Scratch is a great way to try out programming using blocks (like code.org), and allows you to design and move characters around on screen to create games and animations.


## Resources
There are some great mini-projects to try out at:
* [Code Club](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/)
* [CoderDojo](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/coderdojo)

We have a selection of these courses/projects printed out to try, if you can't see them just ask one of the mentors.

## Getting started
[Scratch can be accessed here.](https://scratch.mit.edu/) Currently they use Flash to run run their editor, if you have your own computer then you should be fine, as are the Chromebooks (you'll need a Google login to use them). Some of the other computers have Flash on, and some don't, so if you want to use one of them you may have to try a few to find one that works.
