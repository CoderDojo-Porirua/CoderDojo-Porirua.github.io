# Learn to code with CoderDojo at Whitireia!  

Interested in coding, but not sure how to tell an Android from an Arduino? Keen to get started with hacking, but unsure where to start? Then our **free 2 hour introduction to Coding** sessions are for you!

As part of [Tech Week 2017](http://techweek.co.nz/), and in association with [Whitireia](http://www.whitireia.ac.nz/Pages/home.aspx) and [Porirua City Council](http://pcc.govt.nz/), we're running two free Introduction to Coding sessions aimed at Year 10-13's.

You bring:

- A laptop if you have one.
